# CNN_visualization
 This is my implementation (plus a demo) of CNN feature visualization. Reference: Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks.
 The visualization result is not as clear as the paper shows. I assume it's because of they use different architecture and we have a small dataset for visualization. However, it may due to undetected bugs (I hope not..) If you find any mistakes about my code, please tell me!
