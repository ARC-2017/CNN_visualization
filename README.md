# CNN_visualization
 This is my implementation (plus a demo) of CNN feature visualization.

 The way to just look at the ipython notebook. Use link: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/guruucsd/CNN_visualization/blob/master/urban_tribe/caffe/deconv_demo.ipynb


 Reference: Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks.

 The visualization result is not as clear as the paper shows. I assume it's because they use different architecture and we have a small dataset for visualization. However, it may due to undetected bugs (I hope not..) If you find any mistakes about my code, please tell me!
